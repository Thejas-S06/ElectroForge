# **⚡ ElectroForge**

_“Experiment. Engineer. Evolve.” 🔧💡_

ElectroForge is the personal tech space of Thejas S — a hub for exploring electronics, embedded systems, and creative engineering.

This repository captures my journey of building, experimenting, and learning hands-on with hardware and code. 🚀

### **🗂️ About This Repository**

ElectroForge is where ideas meet implementation.
It brings together projects that showcase practical electronics, clean coding, and the curiosity to keep improving.

Perfection isn’t the aim; progress and learning by doing drive every build.
